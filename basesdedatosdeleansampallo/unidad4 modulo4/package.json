  "description": "hi my name is zenitha kobayashi mizoguchi deoky hertz kruger skell and i am a small multibreast and multitailed female anthro weresquirrel slash wereskunk slash werehyena slash werebear hybrid girl. yup. thats right. what i am is not a joke, not a funny pun, not a pun intended joke, not a meme, not a anything related to memes slash jokes, is real, because what i am is actually reality itself even when it is not supossed to be real. after all, what i am is maybe something from like a dream. but that doesnt mean you are dreaming or seeing halucinations. in fact, you are not dreaming or hallucinating. i am actually real. meaning, it is not a joke, not a meme, its real. what you are seeing right now is a actual f-ing hyper ultra realistic small multibreast and multitailed female anthro weresquirrel slash wereskunk slash werehyena slash werebear hybrid person which in this case is a girl. and a fun fact about this type of stuff. you may be probably wondering how i actually have ended up in this situation that i admire slash adore slash like slash love a lot, or in this case probably in your mind having that question that may not be in your mind or anywhere else, but since you are seeing this you may say go ahead. and well is a gigantically slash comically large slash humongous slash gigantically humongous slash hyper gigantically colosal humongous slash well the list goes on of infinite number of size kind of long story and i know what you are gonna say dude that is like an endless story been written for origin story base of stuff and well let me tell you it seem that way which for me is perfect that is like an endless story and that is due to the fact that i lost count of the many things that occured in the origin story which when that came to it looking like well you know how it goes i was like bahh f-it i dont have that much time to remember it all lets just say it that way and you know the list goes on but to say that it almost feels like the origin story must be based on just some young female kiddo that in the origin story the protagonist was just like the rest of the human race well that is actually how it is based due to the fact that the almost feels like part is actually it feels like which in this case it should be but to say that it feels like the origin story is definitely based on just some young female kiddo that in the origin story the protagonist was just like the rest of the human race which actually makes more sense along side with the other fact actually is a fun fact that it just to say that all that to say about it its actually true and part of the origin story because there might be around a me that looks like what you are seeing in the rest of the whole origin story but that is just the mayority of the whole origin story as a matter of a fact that i wasnt always like this in the whole origin story the truth is in the origin story i was just a normal young female kiddo human being who had troublesome stuff that you would not want to know about and in the best part in my opinion or whatever you think of it part i was just minding my own business and usual stuff until out of the blue an attempt of an actual invasion just decide to roll into action with many evil npcs that happen to look like militia types who were poking around wanting to expand their kingdoms or territories to multiversal timeline level which is a whole new level in the other timelines that were not aware of this stuff like it was all based on a conquest for actual stuff that you also would not want to know about their looks for their own personal militia look is all based of big boy hyper slash ultra slash huge hyper ultra high end gear meaning that one of their atributes is actually be seriously financed which makes it the perfect gift that if anyone knows that evil npcs will use everything at their disposal for an invasion on the anyone they would find what the militia types who have in their arsenal seriously financed expensive toys have in their arsenal the perfect gift for christmas which makes them more than just militia npcs for as a matter of fact they were an actual group of paramilitaries aka rent wing npcs for hire aka ex cops aka ex military and you know the list goes on most of all npcs who can handle heavy weapons like they were paramilitary deaht squads which is actually what they are most of all they are not alone on their first invasion attempt on our timeline they had other faction friendlies around who looked more like cops but is more of cops who shoot on sight who also happen to be corrupt and a fun fact of the two factions who decide to expand their territories via invasions on our timeline is that at the time of the first invasion attempt i did not know them because they were from another timeline that is located in somewhere else but to get the questions of who were the two factions that started all of this nowadays i now know them by name and their names cracha preto aka the black badge and ufe which stands for the letters of cops who shoot on sight aka the fifthy five battalion of sao paulo city police special forces as they are called in the inc which stands for international news conglomerate or as is known in english special forces unit factions that were born in sao paulo which is located in brazil a country that speaks a different language anywho the two factions have come to test our timeline own defense to the maxical effort level fortunately the aliads factions have other ideas about their invasion plans for our timeline leading to a fight that only the aliads factions can win well maybe not eternally but at least in our timeline they have the favor on their side but not before one of the invasion factions had dispatch such a special ray thingy that may look like its not friendly to the enviroment but when i crossed paths with the special ray thingy instead of be like not friendly to the enviroment mode it made ilumanitive crushing sounds before it decide to make such a explosive entrance that flung me around like i was the perfect one to absorbe its own power before doing shocking stuff after all of that drama things were all going to stranger things movie theme and when i wake up one morning and go and look at myself in the mirror it looked harder to reach like somehow all was big to me which was one of the motives that predicts that nothing could prepare me for when i looked at myself at the mirror and the reason that is due to the fact that when i finally managed to get a good look in the reflection i wasnt my normal human self i actually got turned into a small multibreast and multitailed female anthro weresquirrel slash wereskunk slash werehyena slash werebear hybrid person which in this case is a girl meaning that the special ray thingy turned me into this when i saw myself in that form i was so terrified that i got shocked frezed but when i wake up from my shocked frezed i looked like i was back to my normal human self and i was right i was back to my usual self i was reliefed but then when i checked at my phone i realized it was the same day i came as my strange form and i was like wait a minute if i was in my strange form and i came back to my usual form could i go back to my strange form and when i was thinking about it i then got a strange sensation of weirdness and when i looked at my whole body in the mirror it looked like it was changing and i was right my body was becoming something else and when it had ended all i looked at another mirror and i was in my strange form and that could only mean one thing i still am a normal human but i had the ability to go into my strange form anytime i want and the responsible thing was the special ray thingy that was used in the invasion which actually had a glitch that made people absorbe its own power and get anytype of super powers which in this case is wearing two faces via two different forms in one soul and when i realised it i was like wow this is amazing i think i could get used to be in my strange form and it wasnt long before it made into a super hero that is actually an anti super hero cuz i may be super but i am a little bit more of a cold blood payback kind of character which is a little bit exagerated for a super hero but that is what any evil faction would like to see as part of their payments for so in the end thats what they got and you know that is how i got this ability but the rest you may see it in another time because this is not about origin stories or anything else this is about showcasing the many adventures that i had in my pocket waiting to come around so what are you waiting for join me and my friends on our journey across a lot of timelines",
